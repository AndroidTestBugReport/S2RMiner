Teams in the 7000s do not show up anywhere on the app. #step

I think Issue #706 is getting at this same bug.
The new block of teams does show up in an event where they're registered, but you may have to force the app to reconstruct the Teams tabs strip to get a new block to appear in the Teams screen. #step
Workaround: Try switching to the Events screen and back to Teams. #step
Or switch to Events, switch to an older year, switch back, then switch back to Teams. #step

It looks like the teams are now showing up and this was fixed.
However, when going to an event and then clicking on the team, the link doesn't seem to work. #step
For example, the Las Vegas Regional page shows team 7183 on the list of teams, but clicking on it leads you to an empty page. #step
If you search for team 7183 on the app, however, their page comes up. #step
